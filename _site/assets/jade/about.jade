			span.about-lead Ever since Bobby was young,
			|  he was always ambitious about what he wanted in life and would not let 
			| anyone, even his closest friends, get in his way of his goals. 
			| When he started growing up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and later in, Milford, Connecticut, he was never  
			| the popular kid that everyone looked up to and liked, he was actually quite the opposite, he was  
			| the shy kid that everyone would look down upon. However, later he started forming lyrics to a 
			| bunch of his favorite artists' instrumentals, like Kendrick Lamar and Eminem, to name a few, to vent out about 
			| how he felt about life. Then one day, his friends gave him a huge push to release his 
			| first song ever titled, Rigamortis, which was a remix of Kendricks' version. Ever since then, heâ€™s been 
			| continuing to write his words down and share them to the world, hoping one day, he can cement his 
			| name with the rest of the legends from the past, present, and the future of the rap community.
